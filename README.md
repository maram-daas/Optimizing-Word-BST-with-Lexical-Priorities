# tpZ â€“ Binary Search Tree Transformations

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project explores how Binary Search Trees (BSTs) can be transformed through node rotations based on starting characters. It was developed as a practical application of the **Z programming language**, created by **Professor D.E. Zegour** at **ESI Algiers**.

The program reads words from a file, builds different BST structures (BST0 to BST3), and analyzes how tree behavior changes when nodes are prioritized or deprioritized based on their starting letters (e.g. X, Y, Z).

## ðŸŒ³ Trees Used

- **BST0** â€“ plain tree, words inserted in file order  
- **BST1** â€“ words starting with **X, Y, Z** are **moved up toward the root**  
- **BST2** â€“ balances special words by **bringing them to the middle**  
- **BST3** â€“ words starting with **X, Y, Z** are **moved down**, away from the root

> The letters X, Y, Z are configurable.
